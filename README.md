# Meeting Request

**(Please Read Complete Document)**

Hey there,

First of all apologies that I had to bring you here. I wanted to connect with you outside **Fiverr** so that we can discuss the project details which will help me understand the requirements well. Or maybe you're reading this because I would have requested to show you a demo. In both the cases, I'm requesting you to add me on one of the following platforms.

## Skype

**Username**: ```talhasaleem09```
**Link**: ```https://join.skype.com/invite/XlBGmYFFZ4bn```

(If you want to connect on Skype, please type "**Yes Ready**" on Fiverr Message)

## Zoom

**Meeting Url**: ```344 263 3071```
**Password**: ```letmein```

(If you want to connect on Zoom, please type "**Yes Indeed**" on Fiverr Message)

**Note: All the order proceedings will be done on Fiverr.**


## Don't want to connect?

If you not wish to connect outside Fiverr, we can still chat on Fiverr Message. Just type "**Not Today**" so that I understand.

# Very Very Important

This request was only made so to understand and interact with you in a better way. Please understand that Fiverr doesn't allow us to connect outside their platform.

**PLEASE DO NOT MENTION THE PLATFORM NAMES LIKE "SKYPE" OR "ZOOM" OR ANY OTHER PLATFORM ON FIVERR CHAT ELSE WE BOTH WILL BE BLOCKED AND WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO SIGNUP AGAIN.**

Don't forget to let me know.

Thanks and my best wishes.
